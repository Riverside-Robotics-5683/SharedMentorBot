# A version of the 2026CompetitiveConcept
Our project will use MSKi4 Swerve and a custom vision system. 

This repository is based on the code for the WestCoast Products 2026 [Competitive Concept](https://wcproducts.com/pages/wcp-competitive-concepts).

The project is based on one of CTRE's [Phoenix 6 example projects](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix6-Examples/tree/main/java/SwerveWithChoreo). It uses WPILib [command-based programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html) to manage robot subsystems and actions.
